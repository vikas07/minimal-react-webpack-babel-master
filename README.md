# minimal-react-webpack-babel

This is the resultant repository of the walkthrough outlined in [this guide](https://nasidulislam.hashnode.dev/beginners-guide-to-minimal-react-webpack-4-babel-7-project-setup-ck7m7erad00ec8ss1xzmfntqm).

The repo is also an initial requirement for the follow up piece of that guide.

In order to get started, get to a proper directory, maybe `Documents`, then

`git clone https://github.com/all-things-javascript/minimal-react-webpack-babel.git`

...then get inside the repository directory and...

`npm install`
